# toolbox

### Motivation

Most of the daily programming starts from a mature project, before writing some new codes, we always tend to check is there any simliar implementations in the project first (and/or copy from them :)). This is absolutely correct for accelerating project process, but it always creates some new problems: We will lost the chance of figuring out the basic knowledges and design principles for some techniques. For instance, maybe I write a lot of APIs with Spring, but I never try to start a Spring project from zero and then I have no idea about how and why it works; I can use a lot of well-designed high-level APIs, but I know little about inner mechanisms about them ...

So **toolbox**  is desiged to try to tackle those problems. My initial purpose is to record some coding snippets which help me to figure out those problems that I do not clear in my daily work. Any learning process should have a boundary, I will stop when I figured out the problem that confuzed me or finish build some tools really work, so scale of every story would be limited.

### Why named toolbox?

Our minds are state machines, we can only repeat several steps without any toolb, while we can recap what we have learned with some inspiring records and redo what we have achieved before quickly. toolbox is useful, I want a powerful toolbox :)

### Guide

this project is not:

* copycats of tutorial, docs, not something I can get easily from Google of Fxxking manuals
* interview guide, I tend to investigate those topics that really help my daily works 
* LeetCode, which I can practice online, not here

How to add:

* classified with some large topics (Java, Python ...)
* Each catalogue with a README file like this, to illustrate what the problem I have meet and how the code works shortly
